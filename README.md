# wg-tracker

This is a tool to help Gecko developers keep track of resolutions made in
the CSS Working Group.  Whenever a resolution is made and recorded in
[an issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/), a tracking issue
will be filed in the
[csswg-decisions](https://github.com/mozilla/wg-decisions/) repository.
From there, Gecko developers can triage the resolutions and decide whether
to file a bug in [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/) or to close them as
as no action required.

This tool is run on a server maintained by [@heycam](https://github.com/heycam)
and performs changes under the
[@mozilla-apprentice](https://github.com/mozilla-apprentice) user.
